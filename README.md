## Description

---

### Purpose

This project aims to develop a full-stack web application for the sticker shop that serves the following purposes:

* The website displays all of the sticker shop's products, allowing customers to view product details online.
* By creating a website, more people interested in stickers will be able find this sticker brand through a Google search, which increases shop's exposure.
* Customers could shop online and wait for the delivery at home, which saves their time.
  
### Features

This sticker shop application will have the following features:

* Customers are able to browse a list of products in the Home page and click into the link for each product to navigate to a Detail page where they can view detail information of each product 
* Customers can click 'Add to Cart' button on the Detail pages and add products into Cart
* Customers can view their cart before checking out and delete or modify numbers of each product selected
* Customers can click the 'Checkout' button on the Cart page to navigate to a Checkout page where they could fill in their addresses for delivery and place orders
* Customers can find contact info of shop owner and contact the shop if they have any questions.

Above are the basic features of the sticker shop application. Time permitting, the following feature might be implemented:

* Customers are able to register and login to view their order history

### Target audience

This app will target existing customers (mainly the scrapbookers) of the sticker shop and potential customers interested in this sticker brand. These people are targeted to view products and place orders online, which saves their time.

## User Stories

---

### Initial user stories after kick-off meeting:

1. As a scrapbooker, I find it time-consuming to visit different brick-and-mortar craft stores or sticker shops to collect stickers. I want to browse a collection of sticker products on an online platform, so that I can easily find the products I am interested in.
2. As a scrapbooker, I sometimes need stickers in specific theme or design pattern. I want to be able to search for products I want when browsing the products, so that I find what I need faster. 
3. As a scrapbooker, I constantly need to buy new stickers. I want to be able to place orders online and have them delivered to my address, so that I can save the trouble of commuting to a brick-and-mortar sticker shop to buy what I need. 
4. As a scrapbooker, I am very picky with the design of the stickers used for scrapbooking. I want to access contact info of a sticker shop, so that when there are no satisfying products, I can describe my preferred design pattern to the shop owner and hopefully they could find matching products for me.
5. As a scrapbooker who frequently shop online, I want to view my purchase history in my own account, so that I can track products I have bought before (*this is optional and will be realised in register and sign in functions if time permits*)

### In further discussion of the usability of the web application and the UI design, additional user stories are added and extended:

6. As a scrapbooker who tends to purchase stickers in bulk, I want to be able to easily change quantity of selected stickers in my cart, so that I don't have to keep adding the same sticker to cart to get the desired quantity

7. As a scrapbooker shopping online, I want to easily access the details (description, more images, materials, etc) of the sticker products I'm interested in, so that I can have a better understanding of the products and decide if I want to purchase them.

## Project Management with Trello

---

 Trello Board : Our Trello board can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/9oxdHoQc/t3a2-full-stack-app)

We took screeeshots of our Trello each day. These screenshots can be viewed [here](docs/trello.md)

---

We decided to use Kanban project methodology, which is efficient, flexible and allowed us to continously deliver our products. We achieved this by using the Kanban board on Trello.

## Project Management and Task Delegation Methodology

---

We decided to use discord to communicate during this project. Before we started the project, we joined an audio call to divide the project into small tasks, decide the priority of each task, set up the due date of each task and assigned to each member. Each day we communicated about our progression in the morning and dicussed our plan for the day. If we face any issues, we will join the audio call to discuss it immediately. 

We continued to use the Kanban board for part-b and task delegation. We created cards for tasks and label them with different labels, like MVP, Opional, High priority and etc. The Kanban board included several sections, backlog, to-do, doing, testing and done. Initially all cards were in the backlog section of the board, if we planned to do some of the cards, we will move them to the to-do section. When we doing that card, we will move it to the doing section, then testing section. Once it has been completed, we will move it to the done section.

We have grouped tasks into different due dates based on the priority and whether it is MVP. MVP with high priority will have earlier due date, which means we have to complete them first. Once we completed all tasks belongs to one due date(like all tasks that due on 23rd of Jan), we will have an audio call to review what we have done and discuss if there is any new tasks need to be added. If so, we will add new cards to the board. We will also review the due date for tasks that haven't started yet based on the current progression.  

Each card has been assigned to one or two members in the Kanban board, the name of the member can be seen at the bottom right part of the card. Basically, as we only have two memebers, we decided to divide the project into two parts, client-side and server-side, each will be assigned to a member. Member who are more confident with React have been assigned with the client-side, and who are more confident with APIs, express and database models have been assigned with the server-side.

## Implemented Application

---

The deployed application is available at [here](#deployment).

The MVP features of this application includes view product lists, view details of each product, add products to cart, modify cart items, checkout, enter address and receives an order confirmation. We also have some optional features, but we are not able to make it due to time limits. We only create a order model and routes, and we will try to implement these optional features later if we have more time.

## Libraries & Dependencies

---

* **Client**
* `react`: React is a javascript library for building user intergaces. It is based on components. We use it to build the front end(client-side) of our application.

* `nodemon`: Nodemon is used to automatically restarting the node application when changes of the code are detected.



## Testing

---
We have written both unit testing and integration testing for both the client and server side of the application. These tests can be run using vitest at the client side and jest and supertest at server side.

We have also down extensive user testing by ourselves during at both the development stage and production stage. 

### Development testing

During the development stage, we used postman to test the server side of the application.

* **Client**
* Development test:
  Test log is available at [here](docs/client_side_test_log.md)
